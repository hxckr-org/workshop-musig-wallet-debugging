# Workshop: Multisig Wallet Debugging

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of TypeScript implementations of a multisig wallet, each with a different bug. The goal of this workshop is for you to identify and fix the bugs in the code. You should not need to change the code structure, only the logic inside the classes.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code
4. Run `npm run workshop:<name>` to run the test case for the corresponding multisig wallet implementation level.

## JestTest Cases

Each test case has a different set of bugs. You should be able to identify the bugs by running the test case and seeing which one fails.
The solution to the intermediate-musig-solution is provided in the `intermediate-musig-solution.test.ts` file. To run the jest test cases, run `npm run test`.
